# Zoom Software Quality Management Case Study

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Software Quality Management case study based on the Zoom video conferencing platform. The project demonstrates how software quality, defects, and risks can be identified, tracked, and managed using GitHub tools.

## System Description
Zoom is a cloud-based video conferencing system used for online meetings, virtual classrooms, and remote collaboration. The system must maintain high reliability, performance, usability, and security to support large numbers of users.

## Quality Management Objectives
- Identify common software defects affecting Zoom system quality
- Analyze potential risks that may impact system performance and security
- Apply software quality models and process improvement concepts
- Manage quality activities using GitHub Issues and an automated Kanban board

## Tools and Techniques Used
- GitHub Issues for defect and risk tracking
- GitHub Projects (Kanban board) for workflow management
- Labels to classify issues (bug, performance, security, risk)
- Status tracking using Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, and Done

## Workflow Description
All identified defects and risks are first added to the Backlog. After analysis and prioritization, issues move to Ready. Active investigation and resolution take place in the In Progress stage. Completed work is verified in In Review and then moved to Done.

## Project Artifacts
- Software Quality Management Report (Word document)
- GitHub Issues for defects and risks
- Automated Kanban Project Board

## Conclusion
This repository demonstrates a practical approach to software quality management by combining theoretical analysis with real-world tools to ensure traceability, transparency, and continuous quality improvement.
